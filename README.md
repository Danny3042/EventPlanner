# MediApp

## App Design
My inspiration drew from many people fearing from being judged or labelled as being weak for seeking mental health support with cultural and social beliefs on discouraging individuals from reaching out. 


To solve this stigma, I have developed an app to encourage mental health with fun games in AR to attract all ages. The core of the app revolves around educating users about meditation techniques using minigames and exercises prompting the user to pop bubbles or breathing in and out. 

Technologically, I utilised Swift for app development using frameworks such as RealityKit, ARKit, UIKit and SwiftUI and incorporating animations for meditation exercise and medication pills. 

By creating this app, my aspiration is for users to appreciate the art of meditation and embracing it. I hope to inspire users to try meditation and that people can see past the stigma and embrace the benefits of meditation by using gamification.
